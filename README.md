# Face-emotion-recognition-with-machine-learning
📌 Project Overview
This project implements a Face Emotion Recognition (FER) system using machine learning techniques. The system detects human faces in images or video streams and classifies the corresponding facial expressions into one of several predefined emotions such as:

Happy

Sad

Angry

Surprise

Fear

Disgust

Neutral

Face Emotion Recognition has various applications in:

Human-computer interaction

Customer feedback analysis

Behavioral analysis

Security and surveillance

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

OpenCV for image processing and face detection

Keras / TensorFlow for building the deep learning model

scikit-learn for data preprocessing and evaluation

Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook for experimentation

🚀 Features
Real-time face emotion detection using webcam

Preprocessing pipeline for facial images

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for emotion classification

Evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix)

Easy-to-use and extensible codebase

🗂️ Dataset
jonathanoheix/face-expression-recognition-dataset


📊 Model Architecture
The CNN model consists of:

Convolutional layers

Max-pooling layers

Dropout layers (to prevent overfitting)

Dense layers

Softmax output layer (for multi-class classification)
